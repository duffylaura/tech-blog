# The Coffee Pawz Tech Blog

## Description 

`AS A developer who writes about tech`
`I WANT a CMS-style blog site`
`SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thougths and opinions`

The Coffee Pawz Tech Blog offers developers a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site where they can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. This web application was built following the MVC paradigm. It utilizes Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. 

The Coffee Pawz Tech Blog was deployed using Heroku (link below).

When you look at existing blog posts on the homepage, you can click on an existing blog post. This will allow you to see the post's title, contents, creator's username, the date it was created, and an option to leave a comment. 

When you click on the dashboard button in the nav bar you will be brought to a page displaying any blog posts you have already created and option to "Create a New Blog Post."
